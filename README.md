# Juice-Bottler-v_2
This project was written by Joseph Ikehara.
It uses a lot of base code from Nate Williams and his code from https://github.com/YogoGit/JuiceBottler

11 October 2017

Aside from code taken from Nate's github and in-class instruction, Joseph Ikehara wrote 100% of the code. 
This README counts as his signature, claiming that this project was his work only.

The most challenging part of this project was learning to restart it. I had another version of this project (hence the name "Juice-Bottler-v_2").
The original version can be found at https://github.com/jikehara/Juice-Bottler.
I struggled for many hours to unsuccessfully integrate workers into threads, but ended up writing workers to only work  one at a time.
